# Voice-Recognition
The main aim of my project is to identify the give input voice is **Male** voice or **Female** voice based on the **Frequnacy** and the **Power Spectrum Density** **[PSD]** 

One more this to be noted is sometimes(rare cases only) male voice will showing as female voice so you should give the male voice as very sharp and hard
